rails comes with `to_json` and `to_xml` on models and you can give them an option map to control how the whole object tree gets serialized.

the first problem I had was that I needed serveral options map at different controllers/actions so I needed a place to store them. the model itself felt to be the wrong place.

the next problem was that I could include the result of a given method with `:methods => ['age']` but only on the root level of the object tree. but if I wanted to `age` method to be part of the serialization somewhere deep inside the object tree, it is not possible.

please have a look at **spec/filter_spec.rb** how to use it :)
